      <h3>Brothers,</h3>
      <p>I would like to welcome you to the Heart of Virginia Scout Reservation and to the 2019 SR-7A Conclave! I am super excited to have all our Lodges here to join in one giant celebration for the centennial of the Order of the Arrow in Virginia. Nawakwa Lodge will be your service lodge and has put in many hours of cheerful service over the past year preparing to provide an outstanding Conclave for all of us to celebrate this momentous occasion.</p>
      <p>I would like to give an enormous thanks to the members of Nawakwa Lodge and staff members, especially the Conclave Chairman Matthew Terhune and Adviser Mark Lloyd. I would also like to thank the SR-7A Council of Chiefs for putting this event together. If you need any assistance during Conclave, please look to anyone wearing a yellow baseball hat with red lettering; our Brothers will be more than happy to help you!</p>
      <p>The theme for this Conclave is Together We Serve. Spend this weekend contemplating how joining together in service has constructed a 100-year legacy from which we can see a bright future for our organization.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>WWW,</p>

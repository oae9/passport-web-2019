      <h3>Arrowmen,</h3>
      <p>It is with great pleasure and eagerness that I welcome you to the 2019 SR-7A Conclave at the Heart of Virginia Scout Reservation. Together we celebrate 100 years of service in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>
      <p>As our membership continues to grow and expand, let us celebrate our diversity and shared experiences as we serve together. Head over to the Conclave service project and prepare foot care packages for the less fortunate of Richmond and cheer on your lodge as they compete in the Quest events. Take advantage of this weekend to forge new friendships, learn a few new things, experience the EXPO, and certainly donâ€™t miss the Saturday night FireFest followed by the Grand Ho-Dag.</p>
      <p>This weekend will go by quickly, so take advantage of every opportunity to engage with others and experience everything Conclave has to offer. Be sure you check the Conclave App often to plan your day and to know about any special events. I hope to see you around camp this weekend enjoying everything that Conclave has to offer because together we serve.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In Cheerful Service,</p>
